SVN - Central version contol system 
GIT - Distributed version control system

1) Version -- git --version

2) User credentials

git config --global user.name "praveengadiyaram369"
git config --global user.email "praveengadiyaram@gmail.com"

git config --list

3) Help

git help config

4)  Check Git status

git status

5) create .gitignore file to add files which you don't want to track

touch .gitignore

6) Working Directory --> Staging Area --> .git Directory

Working Directory - where all untracked and changed files exist  -- Color: Red
Staging Area - where all the files are cached before commit      -- Color: Green
.git Directory - where the last commited files exist             -- Color: ----

7) Adding files to staging Area.

git add file__name
git add -A # _add all files in working Directory to staging Area.

8) Remove cached files from the staging area to working directory.

git reset file__name
git rest # _to reset all files from the staging area.

9) commit files to git repository

git commit -m "commit_message"

10) check all previous commits using log.

git log

11) cloning/downloading a repository

git clone url__repo.git .

12) Creating a branch, when you want to create a desired feature on top of an existing code.

git branch branch__name

13) By default we are in master branch, so we need to change the branch from master to specific branch__name

git checkout branch__name

14) To check all branches created

git branch

15) we need to push our local branch changes to remote(main repository)

git push -u origin branch__name

16) check if there are any remote repositories

git remote -v

17) if there is no result from the above command, then we need to create a remote repository.(https://stackoverflow.com/a/15445062/5671715)

git remote add origin git__url
git remote add origin https://github.com/praveengadiyaram369/MSR-3.git


18) Merging branch with the master

a) checkout master branch 
git checkout master

b) Pull the updated changes to master
git pull origin master

c) merge master branch
git branch --merged

d) merge the branch with master
git merge branch__name

e) Final merge changes from master to origin
git push origin master


19) Delete branch after task is completed.(locally)

git branch -d branch__name # _deletes branch locally, not remotely

20) push the delete brancg changes to remote

git push origin --delete branch__name


push/pull --- makes interactions with remote repository which is common to everyone.
commit --- deals with only branch changes

############################ Updating mistakes ##############################

21) if any commit message is wrongly given, we can update the mesage using amend command of git.

git commit --amend -m "update__msg"

22) if any file is missed during the commmit, we can can to last commit by using amend command(but the missed file should be added and committed)

git commit --amend

23) if you have committed with wrong branch, we can use cherry-pick to resolve the same.

switch to actual branch -- git checkout branch__name
use cherry-pick -- git cherry-pick hash__code__of__the__wrong__commit

24) Reset - rollback the commit -- (reset only, reset soft, reset hard) -- creates problems when other contributors have pulled the changes.

a) reset soft --> git reset --soft hash__code 
only resets one particular commit, changes are kept even after the reset, but in staging Area

b) reset --> git reset hash__code
only resets one particular commit, changes are kept even after the reset, but in working directory

c) reset hard --> git reset --hard hash__code
reset to code with particular hash code and changes from the tracked files are completely deleted.

d) To remove the changes from the untracked files, we can use --> git clean -df 

25) Even after the reset, we can get back the changes using checkout.

git checkout hash__code

After getting the hard rest changes back to code, we need to create a branch which that code, as we are in detached code branch.

git branch backup

we can get all commit changes hascode using reflog.

git reflog

26) Inorder to prevent the collision of resetting the changes and others pull requests, we can safely do a revert.

git revert hash__code

reverts all the changes by making an extra commit
